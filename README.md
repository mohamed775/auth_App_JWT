## üìÑ Description

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims securely between two parties. It can be used for authentication and authorization in web applications. In the context of Spring Boot login and register functionality, JWTs offer a convenient method for managing user sessions and ensuring secure communication between the client and server.

Here's how JWT-based login and register functionality typically work in a Spring Boot application:

Registration:
-When a user registers for the application, their credentials (such as username and password) are collected through a registration form.
-Upon successful validation and verification, the server generates a JWT containing the user's information (such as user ID, username, and possibly roles or permissions).
-This JWT is then returned to the client and stored, usually in local storage or a cookie, for subsequent requests.

Login:
-When a user attempts to log in, they provide their credentials through a login form.
-The server verifies the credentials, and if they are valid, generates a JWT containing the user's information.
-This JWT is sent back to the client and stored for future authenticated requests.

Authorization:
-For each subsequent request that requires authentication, the client sends the JWT in the request header.
-The server validates the JWT's signature to ensure its authenticity and extracts the user information from it.
-Based on the extracted user information, the server then determines whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource.

Token Expiration and Refresh:
-JWTs typically have an expiration time to mitigate security risks associated with long-lived tokens.
-When a JWT expires, the client needs to refresh it by requesting a new token from the server using a refresh token, if such a mechanism is implemented.
-The refresh token is usually a long-lived token stored securely on the client side, and it is exchanged for a new JWT with a fresh expiration time.

Logout:
-Since JWTs are stateless, there is no built-in "logout" mechanism. Instead, logout functionality usually involves removing the JWT or refresh token from the client, effectively invalidating the session.
-In a Spring Boot application, JWT functionality can be implemented using libraries such as Spring Security along with JSON Web Token Support for Spring Security (spring-security-jwt). These libraries provide utilities for generating and validating JWTs, as well as ------integrating them with Spring Security for authentication and authorization purposes.


## üì¶ Installation

Download package 
- must have internal server like tomcat
- maven / JDK
- intrenal package CMD write --> maven install
- in target will found jar file run it for this command -->  java -jar your-jar-file.jar


## üöÄ Usage

Token Generation:
-When a user logs in or authenticates, the server generates a JWT.
-The JWT typically contains information about the user (such as user ID, username, and possibly roles or permissions).
-This information is encoded into the JWT and signed with a secret key known only to the server.

Token Issuance:
-After generating the JWT, the server sends it back to the client.
-The client stores the JWT, usually in local storage or a cookie, for subsequent requests.

Token Sending:
-For each subsequent request that requires authentication, the client sends the JWT in the request header.
-The JWT is typically sent as an "Authorization" header with the value "Bearer <token>", where "<token>" is the actual JWT.

Token Verification:
-Upon receiving a request with a JWT, the server verifies the token's authenticity and integrity.
-Verification involves decoding the JWT, validating its signature using the secret key, and ensuring that the token has not expired.
-If the verification succeeds, the server extracts the user information from the JWT and proceeds with processing the request.

Token Expiration and Refresh (Optional):
-JWTs can have an expiration time, after which they are no longer considered valid.
-If desired, the server can issue a refresh token along with the JWT.
-When the JWT expires, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new JWT without requiring the user to log in again.

Authorization:
-Once the user's identity is verified, the server can authorize the user to access certain resources or perform specific actions based on the information contained within the JWT.

Token Revocation and Logout (Optional):
-Although JWTs are typically stateless and do not have built-in logout functionality, the server can implement token revocation mechanisms.
-Token revocation involves maintaining a blacklist of invalidated tokens, usually stored server-side.
- a user logs out or a token needs to be invalidated for other reasons, the server adds the token to the blacklist, preventing further use.

Token Renewal (Optional):
-If using refresh tokens, the client can periodically exchange a refresh token for a new JWT to ensure continued access without requiring the user to log in again.


## ‚ú® Features

Statelessness: JWTs are stateless, meaning the server does not need to store session state for authenticated users. This reduces server-side storage requirements and improves scalability.

Compactness and Efficiency: JWTs are compact, allowing them to be easily transmitted over networks and stored in cookies or local storage. This efficiency is beneficial for improving performance in distributed systems.

Security: JWTs can be digitally signed using cryptographic algorithms (e.g., HMAC, RSA), ensuring data integrity and authenticity. This helps prevent tampering and unauthorized access to information contained within the token.

Standardization: JWTs are based on open standards (RFC 7519), making them widely supported across different platforms, frameworks, and programming languages. This standardization promotes interoperability and simplifies integration with third-party services.

Flexibility: JWTs support the inclusion of custom claims, allowing developers to encode additional information (such as user roles, permissions, or metadata) directly into the token. This flexibility enables fine-grained access control and customization of authentication mechanisms.

Decentralization: Since JWTs contain all necessary information for authentication and authorization, they can be verified independently by any party with access to the token's signing key. This decentralization eliminates the need for centralized authentication servers, reducing dependencies and potential points of failure.

Cross-Domain Compatibility: JWTs can be used across different domains and origins, enabling single sign-on (SSO) and federated identity scenarios. This allows users to authenticate once and access multiple services or applications without having to reauthenticate.

Performance: JWT verification typically involves lightweight cryptographic operations, resulting in fast and efficient authentication processes. This performance advantage is particularly beneficial for high-throughput or latency-sensitive applications.

Revocation: Although JWTs are stateless, token revocation mechanisms can be implemented by maintaining a blacklist of invalidated tokens. This allows for fine-grained control over user sessions and helps mitigate security risks associated with compromised tokens.

Scalability: Due to their stateless nature and lightweight structure, JWTs are well-suited for distributed and microservices architectures. They can be seamlessly integrated into modern application frameworks, facilitating horizontal scaling and deployment in cloud environments
